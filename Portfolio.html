            customer service including sales, customer care and quality assurance and 3 years’ experience in 
            inventory management. With my vast computer and technology knowledge and customer care skills, I intend 
            to add value to the Communication and Customer Experience industry as technology is transforming our 
            world, changing the way we do business, the way we learn and even the way we communicate.
